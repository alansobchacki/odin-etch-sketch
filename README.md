=============

A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-etch-sketch/)


Disclaimer
-----

This project was built at the beginning of my career as a developer, following [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

It is intentionally left as-is to document my learning journey and to contribute to the open-source community so that other students can learn from the same project stages.

Also, as directed by The Odin Project's guidelines:

> When making interactive projects, like this one, you might be tempted to add more features, improve interactivity, user experience, design and styling of your website, and so on.
> 
> We recommend not doing that, and saving this effort for your portfolio projects. Focus mainly on the requirements of the project.


About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) curriculum. It is the fourth project required for completion of the Foundations Course.

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript.
- [x] Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). Despite the name, do not be tempted to research or use CSS Grid.
- [x] Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
- [x] Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
-- Extra credit
- [x] Add a button that randomize the squares’ RGB values with each interaction.


What I Learned
-----

This project taught me foundational skills like clean code practices, DOM manipulation, event handling, arrays, loops, and basic JavaScript interactivity. 

I also learned the importance of using Flexbox effectively for layout.


Notes
-----

Your cursor draws as it moves through the canvas, and that's intentional.

As the project requested, it had to be a "hover" effect, rather than a click-and-hold effect.

(it would probably work better with a click-and-hold effect but eh)
